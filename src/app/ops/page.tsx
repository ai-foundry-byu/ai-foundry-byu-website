/**
 * The internal operating view. NOT linked from anywhere on the site.
 *
 * This exists because the CEO review named a wall metric (signed contracts
 * against the September target) that must not go on the public roadmap. A
 * prospective client reading "0 contracts signed" is the single most
 * expensive sentence this program could publish about itself. So the outward
 * page shows what is true and appropriate, and the shortfall lives here.
 *
 * On the gate, honestly: a token in the query string is obscurity, not
 * security. It leaks through referrers, browser history, and any log that
 * records full URLs. That is an acceptable trade for internal counts that are
 * embarrassing rather than sensitive, and it would NOT be acceptable for
 * anything private about a person. Nothing on this page is.
 *
 * It fails CLOSED. If OPS_TOKEN is unset in the environment, every request
 * 404s, so a misconfigured deploy hides the page rather than exposing it. The
 * response is 404 rather than 403 so the URL does not confirm that it exists.
