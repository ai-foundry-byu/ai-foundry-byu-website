/**
 * One column, one axis, one thing to do.
 *
 * This page used to be a two-column split: a left rail of four interest items
 * with orange left-border rules, and the embedded form beside it on the right.
 * Two problems with that, and they compound.
 *
 * First, the interests ARE the checkbox options inside the form (see FORMS.md,
 * form 3, field 6). Beside the form they read as a duplicate of something the
 * reader can already see. Stacked above it they read as the legend for it: the
 * page explains the four options with a line each, then the form asks you to
 * pick among the same four by name. Same words, different job.
 *
 * Second, an asymmetric 360px/1fr split cannot coexist with a centred hero. The
 * page had two competing axes, so nothing lined up with anything.
 *
 * Now everything below the header hangs off one 768px column, so the interests
 * ledger and the form plate share both edges all the way down.

              A hairline-divided ledger, one row per interest, not a 2x2 grid and
              not four bordered cards.

              Rejected, in order:

                - Four cards in a 2x2 grid. It introduces a second vertical
                  alignment at the column's midpoint, which is exactly the
                  competing-axis problem the two-column layout had, just smaller.
                - Four across in one row. Even at the max-w-6xl the rest of the
                  site uses, each cell gets about 228px of text, and the longest
                  title needs 253px with its bullet. Two of the four would wrap
                  and two would not. Ragged.
                - Keeping the orange left-border rule per item. Four left rules
                  inside a centred page read as four little left-aligned blocks
                  rather than one block, and the accent has a job at the top of
                  each row instead.

              This is the same divided-list component as VALUES on the landing
              page: a title column wide enough to hold every title on one line,
              and the blurb in the reading column beside it.

              17rem for the title column is measured, not chosen. The longest
              title, "Live BYU-sponsored AI events", renders 235px wide at 16px
              semibold, and the bullet plus its gap adds 18px, so the row needs
              253px. 17rem is 272px, which clears it by 19px. Anything wider takes
              the slack out of the blurb column, which needs it more; anything
              narrower and one of the four titles wraps while the others do not.

              The two columns arrive at md, not sm. At exactly the sm breakpoint
              the column is 592px wide, which leaves the blurb 288px and pushes
              the longest blurb to three lines while the other three hold two. Two
              columns only earn their keep from 768px up, so below that the rows
              stack and the blurb gets the full measure.

              One spacing ladder governs this band, biggest gap outermost, the
              same rule the landing page's mission/values section runs on:

                 6px  title to blurb inside a row when it stacks (gap-y-1.5)
                40px  between rows (py-5, two adjacent rows each give 20px)
                48px  heading to the top of the list (this mt)
                64px  list to the form, because that is a change of task
                96px  band padding, 80px below md

              mt-12 rather than mt-10: at 40px the heading-to-list gap tied the
              between-rows gap and the heading stopped reading as the parent of
              the list. Each step has to beat the one nested inside it.

              1421px tall once its card hits its 640px cap, which it does at any
              plate width over about 724px. At 780 the reader met a 780px window
              onto a 1421px form, so the page had a nested scroll region that
              swallowed trackpad scrolling and hid the submit button behind a
              scrollbar most people never noticed. At 1440 the whole form is on

              It cannot be right at every width: below about 640px the form's
              labels wrap and its content grows past 1440 again, so narrow
              screens still scroll inside the frame. One fixed number cannot fix
