/**
 * Proof. Deliberately modest, because there is no client work to name yet.
 *
 * Every employer below is traceable to a named person's bio on /about, and that
 * traceability is the entire point: a reader who clicks through can verify it.
 * That makes this biography about our own people rather than a claim of any
 * relationship with those companies.
 *
 *   Google          Nathan McCauley
 *   Deloitte        JD Davenport
 *   National Grid   JD Davenport
 *   Ford            Jorge Beltran
 *   BambooHR        Sophia Strong
 *   Leland          Jordan Faust
 *   Cicero          Tate Stevens
 *   Redo            Brandon Jeppson
 *   Yatta Golf      Abe Bedard
 *
 * Entrata is traceable (Sophia Strong) but left off the headline to keep the
 * sentence readable; Deloitte took its slot as the more recognizable name.
 *
 * Goldman Sachs is deliberately NOT here even though Ella Moore's bio names
 * it: she is an incoming summer analyst, and incoming is not shipped. Same
 * reasoning as Siemens below. It goes up when the internship has happened.
 *
 * The rules matter more than the copy:
 *
 *   - **No logos, ever.** A logo reads as endorsement, and there is no
 *     agreement with any of these companies.
 *   - Never "trusted by", "partners", or "in collaboration with". Those claim a
 *     relationship. "Our builders have shipped at" claims a resume.
 *   - Add a name only when you can point at the person on /about whose
 *     employment backs it. Siemens was proposed and left out for exactly this
 *     reason: nobody on the roster lists it.
 *
 * The Anthropic Claude Partner Network membership is HERE as of 2026-07-29,
 * confirmed by Brandon. It is the strongest of the three because it is an actual
 * organisational relationship rather than a resume, so unlike the employer names
 * it is a claim about AI Foundry itself.
 *
 * Still deliberately NOT here: the Claude Certified Architect certification.
 * voice.md says students "pursue" it, and pursuing is not holding. It goes up
 * when somebody has actually passed and not before, because a false
 * certification claim is worse than having no proof at all.
 *
 * All of this is a placeholder for the real thing. The moment a client agrees
 * to be named, one sentence about shipped work replaces this whole block.

   Culture

   Scott's synthesis brief, 2026-08-01: establish the program's cultural DNA
   by gathering principles from four organizations, in the spirit of Brigham
   Young's admonition to gather up all the good and true principles wherever
   they are found. Sources, credited by name on the page:

     Amazon        Leadership Principles
     Bridgewater   the original philosophy
     McKinsey      purpose, mission, and values
     The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
                   Christlike attributes, Preach My Gospel ch. 6

   The principles are synthesized in our own words, never quoted, and each row
   names the organizations it draws from. The two practices (Ask First and the
   red face test) are the Foundry's own.

   This is the draft for the team to review at the Friday meeting; expect the
   language to be edited there.

   Forms

   As of 2026-08-01 the forms are native components (QuoteForm, NetworkForm)
   posting to /api/quote and /api/network, which write to the same Supabase
   project the previous site used. The embedded Google Forms era, including
   the FORMS url map that lived here, is recorded in FORMS.md; the Google
   Forms themselves still exist under aifoundry.byu@gmail.com but nothing on
   the site renders them.

   The deploy now needs two env vars, SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY.
   Both API routes create their client lazily at request time, so a build
   without them still succeeds; only a submission fails.
